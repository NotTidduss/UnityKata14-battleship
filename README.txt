Unity Kata #14 - Battleship

What is Battleship?
	- 2 Player game
	- Guessing game
	- Pencil & Paper game
	- Phase 1: Players place ships on grids.
	- Phase 2: Players try to hit other player's ships by guessing their position.
	- The winner is whoever guesses all the ships first.
	
ToDo:
- implement gamestates (setting, guessing, ending)
- implement Phase 1: settings ships
- implement randomly placing ships into grid (simulate AI for Phase 1)
- implement Phase 3: an actual ending to the game
- implement score system based on number of guesses and some stats (wins, losses, average guesses...)
- implement play again button
- improve Phase 2: let Player 1 & Player 2 change turns after every guess
- refactor grid: make it scalable
- refactor game: make it 3D instead of 2D
